<p>Website: </p>

<p>This website is hosted on GitHub, allowing anyone to view my personal portfolio. The site includes several sections, such as an "About Me," "Projects," and "Contact" page, and is designed to reflect my journey as an IT student, highlighting my skills, projects, and contact information.</p>

<p>I used several external resources to enhance the user experience:</p>

- [YouTube - Learning Transitions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78kx0oHFzi4): This tutorial helped me learn how to apply smooth CSS transitions for hover effects and section animations.
- [FreeConvert Video Compressor](https://www.freeconvert.com/video-compressor): I used this tool to compress the video embedded in the "About Me" section, ensuring good performance without losing quality.
- [MDN Web Docs - addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener): This documentation helped me understand how to use the `addEventListener` function for the navigation menu and scroll events.
- [MDN Web Docs - Custom Scrollbar](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::-webkit-scrollbar): I referred to this page to create a custom, visually appealing scrollbar that fits the theme of my website.
